        <h1><strong>STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN</h1></strong>
        <img src="hevenpic.jpg" width="50%"><br>
        There's a lady who's sure <br>
        All that glitters is gold <br>
        And she's buying <br> 
        a stairway to heaven <br>
        When she gets there she knows <br>
        the stores are all closed <br>
        With a word she can get <br>
        what she came for <br>
        Ooh ooh ooh ooh <br>
        and she's buying <br>
        a stairway to heaven <br>
        There's a sign on the wall <br>
        But she wants to be sure <br>
        'Cause you know <br>
        sometimes words <br>
        have two meanings <br>
        In a tree by the brook <br>
        There's a songbird who sings <br>
        Sometimes all of our thoughts <br>
        are misgiving <br>
        Ooh it makes me wonder <br> 
        Ooh it makes me wonder <br>
        There's a feeling I get <br>
        When I look to the west <br>
        And my spirit is crying for leaving <br>
        In my thoughts I have seen <br>
        Rings of smoke through the trees <br>
        And the voices of those <br>
        who standing looking <br>
        Ooh it makes me wonder <br>
        Ooh it really makes me wonder <br>
        And it's whispered that soon <br>
        If we all call the tune <br>
        Then the piper will lead us to reason <br>
        And a new day will dawn <br>
        For those who stand long <br>
        And the forests <br>
        will echo with laughter <br>
        If there's a bustle <br>
        in your hedgerow <br>
        Don't be alarmed now <br>
        It's just a spring clean <br>
        for the May queen <br>
        Yes there are two paths <br>
        you can go by <br>
        But in the long run <br>
        There's still time to <br>
        change the road you're on <br>
        And it makes me wonder <br>
        Your head is humming <br>
        and it won't go <br>
        In case you don't know <br>
        The piper's calling you to join him <br>
        Dear lady <br>
        can you hear the wind blow <br>
        And did you know <br>
        Your stairway <br>
        lies on the whispering wind <br>
        And as we wind on down the road <br>
        Our shadows taller than our soul <br>
        There walks a lady we all know <br>
        Who shines white <br>
        light and wants to show <br>
        How everything still turns to gold <br>
        And if you listen very hard <br>
        The tune will come to you at last <br>
        When all are one and one is all <br>
        To be a rock and not to roll <br>
        And she's buying <br>
        the stairway to heaven <br>
